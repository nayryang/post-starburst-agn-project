    "\n",
    "The most essential aspect of our project relies on analyzing the emission spectra from observable galaxies. We will be using the MaNGA database, which has mapped spectral measurements across the faces of around ~10,000 nearby galaxies. In order to access this data, we must first get acquainted with sdss-marvin. sdss-marvin is an open-source API that allows us to access MaNGA spectral data through python and is also specifically designed to visualize and analyze these datasets. For our purposes, we will be exclusively demonstrating features with the Maps interface, although you certainly can get acquainted the rest of marvin through their official [documentation](https://sdss-marvin.readthedocs.io/).\n",
