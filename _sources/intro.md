# Post-Starburst vs AGN/SF Regions in Galaxies
Written by Ryan Yang

**Welcome to a short website on a project I conducted over a semester on the nature of Post-Starburst Galaxies!**

The motivation of this project was to research quiescent galaxies, and analyze what causes a galaxy to become quiescent! More specifically, we were interested in the potential roles of AGNs, and signs on whether AGN feedback can cause a galaxy to extinguish.

This project does so by first identifying and analyzing the Post-Starburst regions of a galaxy, which are then compared to the Star-Forming, and AGN activities of a galaxy, to determine any parallels.

This book will mainly serve as a walkthrough of this project, guiding through the methods and choices taken through its completion.
The entirety of the programming code is written in python3, and uses the sdss-marvin API to access the manGA database. We will also discuss the results from this project at the conclusion, with proposed scientific explanations for the trends we observe in the results.
